<h1>easyStorefront: Connecting businesses to the online world</h1>

<p>What we have here is a website that allows users to create and customize a storefront where they can sell products of their choice. In particular, our store creation page allows them to build their store out of individual components without touching a line of code.</p>

<p>To view our website, start from index.html and follow the links from there. As we are not running on a server yet, logging in and signing up is not yet implemented. The store creation page is accessible and functional, but actually saving/generating the store does not work yet.</p>

<p>Because of this, we have prepared an example of what a generated store would look like in the Examples tab. Note that once the example store is entered, there are no links back to the main website - this is an intentional design choice, our product is simply the backend to an individual's store page and does not effect the consumer.</p>

<h2>
Navigation for A1
</h2>
<p>
<h4>Front page of the easyStorefront website: <em>index.html</em></h4>
 This includes the account creation and login functionality, which will be inplemented for the second assignment.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Examples page: <em>examples.html</em></h4>

This page will include links to user's pages, if they choose to opt-in to this page. Linked to from the navbar as shown in index.html, which appears on pages on the main site.
</p>
<p>
<h4>About us: <em>aboutus.html</em></h4>
The about us page, including pictures and bios/roles. Linked to from the navbar as shown in index.html, which appears on pages on the main site.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Store Page settings page: <em>settings.html</em></h4>
This is the page that allows the user to modify their store page. Linked from index.html in the navbar under the Create Store! button, and is the page the user will be sent to upon login.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Example store page: <em>example_store_*.html</em></h4>
These pages show a page as it could be created using our product, albeit roughly customized. 

<br>Subpages:
<ul>

<li><em>example_store_home.html</em>: an optional splash page</li>
<li><em>example_store_products.html</em>: this showcases the Text Block and Product List elements from the settings page</li>
<li><em>example_store_searchresults.html</em>: the page that the a consumer is directed to after querying a search using the search bar.</li>
</ul>


<h2>General layout</h2>
<p>
The root of the webpage is index.html. It includes a short introduction explaining the purpose of the site (easy online storefront) and includes an account creation form. In the navbar at the top, there are links to the about us page, the list of example store made using the product (to be filled for the second assignment, once account/page creation is implemented), and the Create Store! button, which goes to the page for store customization (settings.html) if the user is logged in (not yet implemented).
</p>
<p>
The various preview buttons in settings.html will open a preview tab/window showing current changes.
</p>
<p>
Store pages are entirely separate from our main page, unless the user opts-in to being linked from the examples page in which case there is a link into their store page. The stores are separate entities, just created with our product.
</p>

<h2>
Final Navigation
</h2>
<p>
Once the server is implemented, index.html will be the root, which for the purposes of this explanation will be refered to as easystorefront.com. Any store page will use the user's store name as the subdirectory (i.e. easystorefront.com/storename) and will have subdirectories for home, search, etc. (i.e. easystorefront.com/storename/search). The Create Store! page will likely go under easystorefront.com/storename/settings, and would only be accessible if the user is logged in on the correct account.
