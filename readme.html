<h1>product name</h1>

<p>What we have here is a website that allows users to create and customize a storefront where they can sell products of their choice. In particular, our store creation page allows them to build their store out of individual components without touching a line of code.</p>

<p>To view our website, start from index.html and follow the links from there. As we are not running on a server yet, logging in and signing up is not yet implemented. The store creation page is accessible and functional, but actually saving/generating the store does not work yet.</p>

<p>Because of this, we have prepared an example of what a generated store would look like in the Examples tab. Note that once the example store is entered, there are no links back to the main website - this is an intentional design choice, to keep shoppers concentrated on the goods themselves.</p>

Navigation for A1
</p>
<p>
Front page of the product website: index.html<br>
 This includes the account creation and login functionality, which will be inplemented for the second assignment.
</p>
<p>
Examples page: examples.html<br>

This page will include links to user's pages, if they choose to opt-in to the page.
</p>
<p>
About us: aboutus.html<br>
The about us page, including pictures and bios/roles. Linked to from the navbar as shown in index.html
</p>
<p>
Store Page settings page: settings.html<br>
This is the page that allows the user to modify their store page. Linked from index.html in the nacbar under the Create Store! button, and is the page the user will be sent to upon login.
</p>
<p>
Example store page: example_store_*.html<br>
These pages show a page as it could be created using our product, albeit roughly customized. 

<br>Subpages:
<ul>

<li>example_store_home.html: an optional splash page</li>
<li>example_store_products.html: this showcases the Text Block and Product List elements from the settings page</li>
<li>example_store_searchresults.html: the page that the a consumer is directed to after querying a search using the search bar.</li>
</ul>
<p>General layout</p>
<p>
The root of the webpage is index.html. It includes a short introduction explaining the purpose of the site (easy online storefront) and includes an account creation form. In the navbar at the top, there are links to the about us page, the list of example store made using the product (to be filled for the second assignment, once account/page creation is implemented), and the Create Store! button, which goes to the page for store customization (settings.html) if the user is logged in (not yet implemented).
</p>
<p>
The various preview buttons in settings.html will open a preview tab/window showing current changes.
</p>
<p>
Store pages are entirely separate from our main page, barring the link back in the footer, unless the user opts-in to being linked from the examples page. The stores are separate entities, just created with our product.
</p>

<p>
Final Navigation
</p>
<p>
Once the server is implemented, index.html will be the root, whose working title is easystorefront.com. Any stoe page will use the user's store name as the subdirectory (i.e. easystorefront.com/storename) and will have subdirectories for home, search, etc. (i.e. easystorefront.com/storename/search). 

<h2>Product backlog</h2>

Portal to other people’s stores, e.g. search for ones in the local area</pre>

<h3>Storefront and Customizations</h3>
<pre>Product list with images for each product
Header/footer with links to other pages on the site
Hours open/avail/etc.
Stores may have contact info or other general information
Products can be tagged to allow searches for specific kinds of products
May include a blog with dated entries</pre>

<h3>The Database</h3>
<pre>customizable fields = schema of the tables, maybe several tables for different kinds of stuff
insert/update/delete a specific type of entry
needs to have image uploading and entry fields for all required attributes
(possible hidden) tag system (check all that apply/ add new tag/remove tag)
search bar somewhere
page that neatly displays all fields of a single product and maybe similar products at the bottom</pre>

<h2>Sprint backlog</h2>
<pre>* setup files on cdf server, using RESTful api
* create logic to dynamically generate store pages, instead of having them static
* implement logins and connect it to store creation</pre>
