<h1>product name</h1>

<p>What we have here is a website that allows users to create and customize a storefront where they can sell products of their choice. In particular, our store creation page allows them to build their store out of individual components without touching a line of code.</p>

<p>To view our website, start from index.html and follow the links from there. As we are not running on a server yet, logging in and signing up is not yet implemented. The store creation page is accessible and functional, but actually saving/generating the store does not work yet.</p>

<p>Because of this, we have prepared an example of what a generated store would look like in the Examples tab. Note that once the example store is entered, there are no links back to the main website - this is an intentional design choice, to keep shoppers concentrated on the goods themselves.</p>
