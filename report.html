<h1>easyStorefront: Connecting businesses to the online world</h1>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Many small businesses and individuals have a product to sell, but are missing the technical knowledge or resources to set up an online storefront. Even those who are capable of setting one up still have other responsibilities to deal with, and will likely end up with a store that is unprofessional or hard to use. The potential loss of sales to competitors with an online presence is harmful, but the cost of having an online website built from scratch can be prohibitive</p>
<h2>Our Solution</h3>
<p>Our solution to this very real problem is to provide a service whereby a user can create a page that includes all the information they need to get out, in a professional looking way, all customised and editted in a quick and easy manner. All a person will have to do is create an account choose the things they want to inclue on their site, upload some pictures, save some products and then fill in some text and then they'll have a functioning website that gets them into the online world. We handle all the hard work of writing the code and upload managment and hosting the site in it's entirety, so the user simply fills some boxes and can get a website that showcases their store.</p>
<p>What we have here is a website that allows users to create and customize a storefront where they can sell products of their choice. In particular, our store creation page allows them to build their store out of individual components without touching a line of code.</p>

<h2>Load/Stress Test</h2>
To perform the stress test the ab program was used to simulate requests to various points around the site at differing levels of concurrency. Specifically, for each test a total of 3000 requests were made at 5, 50, 200, 500, or 1000 concurrent requests. The results of these tests are shown below.

In the original code (as submitted for A2) a connection was made to the database as needed. Evidently, this logic does not scale well, essentially reducing the server to a handful of concurrent requests at a time.
<br>
Once the instability of the multiple connection method was found, we decided to aabndone it in favor of a single connection that persists throughout the entire function of the server. The daa shows this to be a much more effective method for the server
<br>


<p>
For every graph below, the x axis is the percentage of requests (note the non-linear scale) and the y-axis is the time in miliseconds for the percentage of requests to be served.

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>One of the major limitations of the project is that it is being run from the CDF servers. As such, our project server is subject to varying levels of performance. This makes load testing espetially difficult, since one cannot guaruntee uniform load on the cdf servers so the results of the load testing done may mnot be entirely accurate. Additionally, CDF limits the number of processes available to an individual user, giving a hard cap on the amount of concurrency testable (and is empirically around 1000 concurrent requests).</p>
